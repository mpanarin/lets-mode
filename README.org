* lets-mode

  This is a very slim package for configuring and running [[https://github.com/lets-cli/lets][lets]] tasks

** Features list:
   - File type recognition
   - Company completion backend
   - Helm integration to run the tasks
** TODO list [1/4]
   - [X] Make a proper parsing of ~lets~ results for command running
   - [ ] Integrate with projectile
   - [ ] Running commands is very basic. Integrate with ~magit-popup~ for arguments passing
   - [ ] Check if possible to make compilation mode properly work with overwriting lines
** Installing
   Currently it is only installable through ~load~
   Clone the package:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   git clone https://github.com/mpanarin/lets-mode.git -b master *where/to/clone*
   #+END_SRC

   After that load and require the package in your emacs config
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   (load "*where/you/cloned*/lets-mode.el")
   (require 'lets-mode)
   #+END_SRC
